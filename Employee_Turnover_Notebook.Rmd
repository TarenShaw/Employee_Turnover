First we load all the packages we will be using for theis study. I recommend installing the package packman and using one of its built in function, p_load, to load/install mutliple packages at a time.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,readr, lubridate)
```

We then load the dataset we will use for this project

```{r include=FALSE}
df <- readr::read_csv("HRDataset_v9.csv")
```

And we can skim our data 

```{r}
skimr::skim(df)
```
Of the 18 character variables, two should be coded as dates, therefore we transform them using a mutate function.

```{r}
df <- df %>% mutate(`Date of Termination` = mdy(df$`Date of Termination`), `Date of Hire` = mdy(df$`Date of Hire`), Md_termination = format(`Date of Termination`,'%Y-%m'))
```

Lets see the minimum and maximum values for our data that we are working with.
